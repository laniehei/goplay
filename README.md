This is a custom shortcode designed to allow the user to add a link to their Hugo website that is produced by the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/) with the intent of producing a sandbox for users. This is meant to be used in conjunction with the built-in highlight shortcode. Instructions and rationale associated with the code can be found in the blog post on [my site](https://lanie.dev/tech/opensource/).
